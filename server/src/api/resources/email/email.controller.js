// Explanation:

/*
 * To make this token a one-time-use token, I encourage you to 
 * use the userâ€™s current password hash in conjunction with 
 * the userâ€™s created date (in ticks) as the secret key to 
 * generate the JWT. This helps to ensure that if the userâ€™s 
 * password was the target of a previous attack (on an unrelated website),
 * then the userâ€™s created date will make the secret key unique 
 * from the potentially leaked password.

 * With the combination of the userâ€™s password hash and created date, 
 * the JWT will become a one-time-use token, because once the user 
 * has changed their password, it will generate a new password hash 
 * invalidating the secret key that references the old password
 */
